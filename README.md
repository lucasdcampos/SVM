# SVM (Simple Virtual Machine)

This is a simple stack based virtual machine that I made to learn more C programming (and VMs in general).

I don't code in C, neither I have knowledge about Virtual Machines, this was just a fun experiment.

**PS.** In the future I want to create a compiler for a custom programming language that will run on a VM.
